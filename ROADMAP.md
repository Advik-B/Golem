Here is my personal roadmap for porting the Purpur server to Go, including the integration of a `goja`-based plugin system. This is a massive undertaking, so I have broken it down into a series of logical phases.

My core philosophy for this project is:
1.  **Build a Vanilla Core First:** I will re-implement the essential Minecraft server functionality in Go.
2.  **Layer Purpur on Top:** I will use the `.patch` files from the context as a feature checklist to modify my vanilla Go implementation.
3.  **Design for Extensibility:** I will build the core with the plugin system in mind from the start.

### **My Project Roadmap: Porting Purpur to Go with Goja**

#### **Phase 0: Foundation & Tooling**

**Goal:** My first priority is to understand the necessary protocols and formats and set up my Go development environment.

*   **1. Master the Minecraft Protocol:**
    *   **Action:** I will deeply study the protocol documentation on [wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Protocol). It is essential that I understand the packet structures, data types (`VarInt`, NBT), and the state machine (Handshaking -> Status -> Login -> Play).
    *   **Tooling:** I will not reinvent the wheel. I will choose an existing Go library like `gophertunnel/minecraft` to handle low-level packet serialization and NBT parsing, making it my networking foundation.

*   **2. Understand the Anvil World Format:**
    *   **Action:** I will learn how Minecraft worlds are stored in region files (`.mca`) and how to read/write chunk data.
    *   **Tooling:** I will find a Go library that can parse the Anvil format to accelerate development.

*   **3. Catalog Purpur Features:**
    *   **Action:** I will treat the `.patch` files as a feature specification document. I will create a master list, categorizing each feature (e.g., Mob AI, Gameplay Mechanic, Command). This list will be my guide for Phase 4.

#### **Phase 1: The "Hello, World" Server - Connection & Login**

**Goal:** My focus in this phase will be to get a Minecraft client to successfully connect, log in to an empty, non-interactive world, and not get disconnected.

*   **1. Build the TCP Server:**
    *   I will use Go's `net` package to create a TCP server listening on port 25565. For each new connection, I will spawn a new **goroutine** to handle that client's lifecycle.

*   **2. Implement the Connection State Machine:**
    *   Within each client goroutine, I will implement the protocol's state machine. This involves handling the `Handshaking` state to determine if it's a status ping or a login attempt.
    *   I will implement the `Status` state to respond with my server's MOTD, version, and a static player count.
    *   Initially, I will implement an `offline-mode` `Login` sequence, generating a UUID for the player and sending the `Login Success` packet to transition them to the `Play` state.

*   **3. Implement the Initial "Play" Packet Sequence:**
    *   After a successful login, I will send the minimum required packets to get the client into the world. This includes the `Login (Play)` packet, `Player Abilities`, `Held Item Change`, `Synchronize Player Position`, and, most importantly, a `Chunk Data` packet for a single, empty chunk to allow the client to render the world.

#### **Phase 2: World State & Game Loop**

**Goal:** I will create the core data structures for a living world and a ticker to update it.

*   **1. Define Core Data Structures:**
    *   `config.go`: I will create a `Config` struct that directly maps to `purpur.yml` and use a YAML library to load it on startup.
    *   `world.go`: The `World` struct will be the single source of truth for the game state, containing maps for players, entities, and chunks, all protected by a `sync.RWMutex`.
    *   `entity.go`, `player.go`, `chunk.go`, `block.go`: I will define the base structs for all game objects.

*   **2. Create the Main Game Loop (The "Ticker"):**
    *   I will use a `time.Ticker` in my main goroutine to create a 20 TPS loop. On each tick, this will call my central `world.Tick()` method.

*   **3. Implement `world.Tick()` Logic:**
    *   The `world.Tick()` function will be responsible for processing player input received from other goroutines, ticking all entities to apply physics and AI, handling random block updates, and sending periodic `Keep Alive` packets.

#### **Phase 3: Basic Interactivity & Persistence**

**Goal:** I will enable players to see each other, move, interact with blocks, and have the world persist between sessions.

*   **1. World Persistence:**
    *   I will implement `world.LoadChunk(x, z)` and `world.SaveChunk(x, z)` using my chosen Anvil library. The server will load chunks around players and save them periodically.

*   **2. Entity Broadcasting:**
    *   I will implement the logic to broadcast player movement and join/quit information to all other clients within render distance.

*   **3. Basic Block Interaction & Physics:**
    *   I will implement simple collision detection and handle incoming packets for block digging and placement, updating the world state and broadcasting the changes.

---

#### **Phase 4: Implementing Purpur's Features**

**Goal:** I will begin transforming my vanilla Go server into Purpur, using the feature catalog I created in Phase 0.

*   **1. Configurable Mechanics:**
    *   I will iterate through my `purpur.yml` config struct and start implementing features.
    *   **Example: Ridable Mobs:** This is a major feature. I will add `Ridable` and `Controllable` booleans to my entity structs, loaded from the config. My packet handler for player interaction will check these flags to initiate riding. The mob's `Tick()` method will then check for a rider and apply their input to its movement, referencing the logic in Purpur's `controller` classes.

*   **2. Custom Commands:**
    *   I will create a simple command handler map (`map[string]func(...)`). When a `Chat Command` packet arrives, I'll parse it and execute the corresponding function. I will implement commands like `/ping`, `/tps`, and `/uptime` by accessing my server's internal state.

#### **Phase 5: The Goja Plugin System**

**Goal:** My final phase will be to architect and implement the JavaScript plugin loader and API for server extensibility.

*   **1. Design the API Surface:**
    *   I will create dedicated API wrapper structs in Go (e.g., `PlayerAPI`, `ServerAPI`). These will expose a safe and stable set of methods to JavaScript, hiding the underlying implementation details.

*   **2. Build the `PluginManager`:**
    *   I will implement the `PluginManager` to scan a `/plugins` directory, parse each `plugin.json` manifest, and load the main script file.

*   **3. Implement Plugin Isolation:**
    *   Crucially, when enabling each plugin, I will create a **new and separate `goja.Runtime`**. This ensures that one plugin cannot crash another or the main server. I will inject my `ServerAPI` object as a global `server` variable into each runtime.

*   **4. Implement the Event Bus:**
    *   I will create an `EventManager` in Go that exposes an `events.on(eventName, callback)` function to JavaScript. When my Go server code needs to trigger an event (like a player joining), it will call `eventManager.Fire("playerJoin", ...)`, which will then execute all registered JS callbacks for that event.

*   **5. Implement the Command Registrar:**
    *   I will build a `CommandManager` that exposes a `commands.register(commandName, callback)` function to JS. My server's command handler will first check this manager for plugin-registered commands before falling back to native commands.
